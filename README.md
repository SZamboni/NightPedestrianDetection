# Pedestrian detection at night with Deep Learning
Pedestrian detection at night with Deep Learning project done for the Research Methodology and Scientific Writing course of periods 1 and 2 (from September 2019 to January 2020) held by Mihhail Matskin at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The task was to improve the state-of-the-art techniques for detection using deep learning on dark images.
The project has been done by Olivier Nicolini and Simone Zamboni. In this repository also the report for the course project can be found.

The chlannege is to test and improve the performance of various Deep Learning architecture (Faster-RCNN, Yolo ecc..) on the NightOwls dataset* that contains thousands of images of pedestrian at night.
